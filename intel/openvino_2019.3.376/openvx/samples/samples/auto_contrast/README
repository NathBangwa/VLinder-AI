1 Sample Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Auto Contrast sample demonstrates usage of the OpenVX* for acceleration 
of image processing tasks. It explains the basics of OpenVX development step by step.

It also shows basic interoperability with OpenCV, which is used for loading/saving
and displaying of the images.

Specifically, the sample implements auto-contrast via histogram equalization:

                             >|channel extract|->Y->|equalize_hist|-
                            /                                       \
RGB(in)->|convert|->NV12->|channel extract|----->U-------------|combine|-->|convert|->RGB(out)
                            \                                       /
                             >|channel extract|->V----------------- 
 
Refer to the sample User's Guide (PDF) for details.


2 System Requirements for Building and Running the Sample
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need the following software to compile the sample:
  - Ubuntu* 16.04, CentOS 7.3 or Windows 10 operating system
  - CMake 2.8.12 and higher
  - gcc 4.8.4 and higher (Ubuntu only)
  - GStreamer* 1.0 (Ubuntu only)
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (Windows only)
  
Note, that not all samples support build under Windows.

See the README file in the sample root directory for information on installing 
and running the samples and system requirements for target platforms.


3 Sample Directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sample directory has the following structure:

  +-- auto_contrast (a separated directory per sample)
      |
      +-- auto_contrast.cpp (main sample file with code)
      +-- CMakeLists.txt    (CMake file for the sample)
      +-- low_contrast_vga.jpg (default input to the sample, 640x480 RGB image)
      +-- sample_auto_contrast_user_guide.pdf (detailed sample User's Guide)
      +-- README (this readme file)

4 Basic Command-line Options 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: command line parameters (keys and values) are case-sensitive. 

To get detailed list of command-line parameters, run the sample with '-h' 
('--help'):

    $ ./auto_contrast  --help
 
By default the sample loads and processes the low_contrast_vga.jpg, in the 
sample directory. 
- To change the input, use '-i' ( or '--input') 
- To store the output as a file, use '-o' ('--output') 
- To process input as a gray-scale image, use the '-g' 
Example command-line:
    $ ./auto_contrast  -i ../images/test.jpg -g -o result.jpg

- To loop the graph execution, which provides 
more stable performance numbers, use '-l or '--loops':
Example command-line:
    $ ./auto_contrast  -l 10

- To skip rendering of the input/output images, use '-n' (or '--no-show') 
This option is useful when you running outside the GUI environment.
