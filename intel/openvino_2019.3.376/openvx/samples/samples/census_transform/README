1 Sample Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Census Transform sample demonstrates usage of the OpenVX* for acceleration
of image processing tasks. It explains the basics of OpenVX development step by step.

It also shows basic interoperability with OpenCV, which is used for loading
and displaying of the images.

Specifically, the sample implements CENTRIST visual descriptor calculation:

RGB(in)->|convert|->YUV->|channel extract|->Y->|Sobel3x3|->X,Y gradients->|Magnitude|->Edges gray scale image->
->|Census Transform User Node|->CT gray scale image->|Histogram|->CENTRIST values


Refer to the sample User's Guide (PDF) for details.


2 System Requirements for Building and Running the Sample
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need the following software to compile the sample:
  - Ubuntu* 16.04, CentOS 7.3 or Windows 10 operating system
  - CMake 2.8.12 and higher
  - gcc 4.8.4 and higher (Ubuntu only)
  - GStreamer* 1.0 (Ubuntu only)
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (Windows only)
  
Note, that not all samples support build under Windows.

See the README file in the sample root directory for information on installing 
and running the samples and system requirements for target platforms.


3 Sample Directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sample directory has the following structure:

  +-- census_transform (a separated directory per sample)
      |
      +-- main.cpp (main sample file with code)
      +-- census_transform_impl.c (Census Transform core function SSE implementation)
      +-- census_transform_lib.c (Census Transform user node definition)
      +-- census_transform_module.c (Census Transform user node implementation)
      +-- census_transformtiled_lib.c (Census Transform Tiled user node definition)
      +-- census_transformtiled_module.c (Census Transform Tiled user node implementation)
      +-- vx_usercensus_nodes.h (Census Transform nodes and helper functions declarations)
      +-- vx_censustransform_opencl_lib.cpp (Census Transform Tiled user node definition (device kernel ext.))
      +-- vx_censustransform_opencl_module.cpp (Census Transform user node implementation (device kernel ext.))
      +-- vx_censustransform_opencl_impl.cl (Census Transform OpenCL device kernel implementation)
      +-- CMakeLists.txt    (CMake file for the sample)
      +-- toy_flower.mp4 (default input video sequence to the sample)
      +-- sample_census_transform_user_guide.pdf (detailed sample User's Guide)
      +-- README (this readme file)

4 Basic Command-line Options
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: command line parameters (keys and values) are case-sensitive.

To get detailed list of command-line parameters, run the sample with '-h'
('--help'):

    $ ./census_transform  --help

By default the sample loads and processes the low_contrast_vga.jpg, in the
sample directory.
- To change the input, use '-i' ( or '--input')

- To disable visualization, use '-n' ('--no-show')
This option is useful when you running outside the GUI environment.

- Debug output can be enabled with the --debug-output parameter. In this case
performance window that shows relative execution time for each node is displayed.

- To use Census Transform user node without Intel advanced tiling extension, use '--no-tiled'

- To use Census Transform OpenCL device kernel user node (doesn't support tiling now), use '--opencl --no-tiled'

- To setup number of frames to be processed, use the '-f' ('--max-frames')

Example command-line:
    $ ./census_transform  -i toy_flower.mp4 -f 100 --no-tiled
