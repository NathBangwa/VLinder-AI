# VLinder AI

VLinder AI is an intelligent road traffic monitoring system. 

VLinder AI allows to provide interesting statistics by observing road traffic or parking in real time. 

VLinder is based on the (*Person Vehicle Bike detection crossroad 0078* model)[https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2018_R5/_docs_Security_object_detection_crossroad_0078_caffe_desc_person_vehicle_bike_detection_crossroad_0078.html] of the Intel Openvino tool [https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/].

The information provided by VLinder is the number of people, the number of vehicles and the number of bikes in real time. And this information can then be used by the owners of the parking spaces (companies, shops, etc.) and also by the service. 
The owners of the parking spaces will use VLinder to find out for example if there is a space available for a vehicle or not, the number of bikes present, and also the number of people present in the parking at a given time and the number of people who have passed in one day.

 The traffic control services will use VLinder to be able to follow the state of the traffic in real time.
 
In the long term VLinder will also provide information about the level of congestion on a line, which is very interesting and important information for drivers and traffic control services to take the necessary measures. This ability to predict in real time the type or level of congestion will make VLinder an even more unique system.
